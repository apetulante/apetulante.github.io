    "### What is reinforcement learning?\n",
    "In a typical LLM training paradigm, models are first trained in an **self-supervised** manner to predict a masked-out word. This makes them great at understanding how language is constructed, and helps us to make giant datasets very easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, models trained to simply predict what word comes next are not very helpful to talk to. If I ask a model trained in this manner _\"What kind of tree is a cedar?\"_ It may respond _\"I would really like to know about cedar trees.\"_ because it thinks it should be continuing the thought.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step, then, in LLM training, is typically **instruction fine tuning (IFT)**. In this step, models are trained to respond and follow instructions. In this step, they come to recognize when they are being asked a question, and the language produced thereafter becomes a *response* not simply a *continuation*. After IFT, a model might respond: _\"coniferous\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "The model now answers the question (hopefully correctly.) But it may not be friendly, or be too terse, or not structure its answers particularly well, or even be mean and harmful. So, the last step in training is typically **reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF, or just RL)**. In this step, the model is told what responses of its are better and encouraged to respond in that type of way. While this can adjust the responses in many ways, one example is that it may encourage more information or detail, or generally more wordiness. So, a model trained with RL may respond _\"A cedar is a type of coniferous tree in the genus Cedrus. Cedars are evergreen trees known for their aromatic wood, needle-like leaves, and cones. They belong to the family Pinaceae.\"_\n",

    "In \"traditional\", supervised training of a transformer or neural network, which you're likely familiar with, the process looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have training data with inputs and known correct outputs\n",
    "2. The model makes predictions\n",
    "3. You calculate a loss function (like MSE or cross-entropy) that measures how wrong the predictions are\n",
    "4. Backpropagation updates the weights to minimize this loss\n",
    "5. Repeat until the model gets good at predicting correct outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "The key here is that for every input, you know exactly what the correct output should be.\n",

    "When training an LLM with RL, we face several unique challenges that mean we must make our updates carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Catastrophic Updates: If we make too large a change to the model based on rewards, we risk losing the model's existing knowledge or ability to generate coherent text, and can easily get stuck in local optima (like repeating high-reward words)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Discrete Actions: During text generation, an LLM model repeatedly chooses from a vocabulary of discrete tokens. As such, a single \"action\" (generating text) involves many individual, discrete actions (choosing the next token), making it harder to know which \"choices\" led to good or bad outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enter PPO\n",
    "PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) is a technique for training the model in a way that moves towards maximizing our reward, but slowly and carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "In PPO, a 'policy' refers to the model's strategy for generating outputs—in an LLM's case, how it predicts and constructs sentences token by token (basically, the model itself). An **'old policy'** is the model as it currently functions, and a **'new policy'** is an updated version that tries to generate outputs more aligned with the reward signal.\n",
    "PPO carefully balances exploration (trying new strategies) with stability by limiting how far the new policy is allowed to deviate from the old one. This ensures gradual, meaningful improvements without destabilizing the models ability to generate coherent text."

    "- Acting: Generating text given a prompt\n",
    "- Calculating Probabilities: Telling us how likely it would be to generate specific text\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Clipped Objective:**\n",
    "This is PPO's real metric for improvement. It includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Probability Ratio (r): How much more/less likely is the new policy to generate certain text compared to the old policy?\n",
    "- Clipping: We put boundaries on this ratio (typically between 0.8 and 1.2)\n",
    "- Advantage (A): How much better/worse was the outcome than expected?\n",
    "\n",
    "For LLM's, PPO is implemented on a **token-by-token basis**, so each token gets the opportunity to be better or worse for the outcome. In this way, PPO is not exactly a loss function but uses a surrogate objective (a type of loss function) to guide updates. It incorporates the reward by comparing the new policy’s performance (via probabilities of actions, i.e., token predictions) to the old policy’s performance, scaled by the reward."

    "But you might be asking, how do we *get* old and new policies? What stages of training to they correspond to? The new policy is the one that we just got via gradient descent. And the old policy is from the previous update.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider going through an epoch of updating a model using PPO. The typical PPO “iteration” (a high-level loop):\n",
    " - Set Old Policy: Copy your current model weights as “old policy.”\n",
    " - Gather Data: Roll out the environment using the old policy.\n",
    " - Compute Rewards & Advantages: Based on the data from step 2.\n",
    " - Run Multiple Mini-Batch Updates: Each update modifies the model from ($\\pi_{\\theta(old)}$) to ($\\pi_{\\theta}$)\n",
    "\n",
    "After these updates finish, your “new policy” ($\\pi_{\\theta}$) is typically quite different from ($\\pi_{\\theta(old)}$).\n",

    "> 📌 <font color=\"#996565\">**Note**: As you might have guessed, this is a little bit more nuanced at the *start* of an iteration, as we don't really yet have a $\\pi_\\theta$ to act as the new policy yet!

See [Appendix 3](#A_3) for a much more in-depth discussion of this, including why **mini-batches** can improve learning with PPO over i.e full stochastic gradient descent.</font>"

    "- **Update the value function**: The value function (which is part of the model from `AutoModelForCausalLMWithValueHead`) estimates the expected reward for a given state is also updated.\n",
    "- **Enforce KL divergence**: Ensures the new policy doesn't deviate too far from the old policy, maintaining coherent text generation\n",

    "### (2) More About Negative Rewards in Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "When implementing PPO for LLMs, handling negative rewards requires careful consideration. Let's explore how negative rewards affect the training process and some practical approaches to addressing the challenges they present.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our PPO implementation, we observed that negative rewards lead to a situation where clipping may not function as intended. To recap, the PPO objective is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L_{\\text{CLIP}}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\min(r_t(\\theta)A_t, \\text{clip}(r_t(\\theta), 1-\\epsilon, 1+\\epsilon)A_t)\\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "When we have a negative advantage $A_t$ (derived from a negative reward), the relationship between the clipped and unclipped terms reverses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For positive advantages, clipping prevents the probability ratio from exceeding $1+\\epsilon$, limiting how much we reward \"good\" behaviors\n",
    "\n",
    "- For negative advantages, we'd want to limit how much we penalize \"bad\" behaviors, but the minimum operation still selects the more negative value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically:\n",
    "- If $r_t(\\theta) > 1+\\epsilon$ and $A_t < 0$, then $r_t(\\theta)A_t < \\text{clip}(r_t(\\theta), 1-\\epsilon, 1+\\epsilon)A_t$\n",
    "- The min operation selects $r_t(\\theta)A_t$, effectively ignoring the clipping\n",
    "\n",
    "This asymmetry can lead to instability in training, especially when strongly negative rewards are common.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several techniques have been developed to address the challenges posed by negative rewards:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reward Normalization**. One straightforward approach is to normalize rewards across a batch or trajectory. This centers the rewards around zero and scales them to a similar magnitude, which can improve training stability. However, it does change the relative scale between different batches or episodes.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "rewards = (rewards - rewards.mean()) / (rewards.std() + 1e-8)\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. **Advantage Clipping**. In addition to clipping the probability ratio, some implementations also clip the advantage values, preventing extremely negative advantages from causing excessively large gradient updates.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "advantages = torch.clamp(advantages, min=-10.0, max=10.0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "3.. **Separate Clipping for Negative Advantages**. A more advanced approach is to modify the PPO objective to clip differently depending on whether the advantage is positive or negative, creating symmetrical clipping behavior regardless of the advantage's sign:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def ppo_loss(ratio, advantage, epsilon=0.2):\n",
    "    if advantage >= 0:\n",
    "        clipped_ratio = torch.clamp(ratio, 1-epsilon, 1+epsilon)\n",
    "        return torch.min(ratio * advantage, clipped_ratio * advantage)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        clipped_ratio = torch.clamp(ratio, 1/(1+epsilon), 1/(1-epsilon))\n",
    "        return torch.max(ratio * advantage, clipped_ratio * advantage)\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. **Positive-Only Rewards**  We can simply avoid negative rewards entirely by using a reward structure that's always positive (as we did/will do in our sentiment reward example). This simplifies training at the cost of potentially less nuanced feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative rewards can have several effects on training stability, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Larger Gradient Updates:* Strongly negative rewards can lead to larger gradient updates, potentially causing the policy to change too rapidly\n",
    "- *Policy Collapse:* Excessive penalties can cause the policy to become overly conservative or even collapse\n",
    "- *Exploration Challenges:* If the model is heavily penalized early in training, it may stop exploring and fail to discover better strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "The best approach to negative rewards depends on the specific application. For tasks where avoiding bad behaviors is critical, negative rewards may be essential, but for creative tasks where exploration is important, positive-only rewards often work better. For complex tasks that require more nuanced feedback, normalized rewards with careful clipping often provide the best balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, many state-of-the-art RLHF implementations use reward normalization combined with conservative clipping to handle both positive and negative rewards while maintaining training stability.\n",

    "### (3) PPO Updates in Mini-Batches\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be wondering, on a deeper level, **exactly** when a policy updates to the \"new\" policy, and when that new policy becomes the \"old\" policy. Let's break it down in a bit more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the absolute simplest example. You have 16 pieces of data, and you process them as *one* batch, so each epoch contains one iteration through the data. This is true **stochastic gradient descent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the policy updates as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/policy-updates-1.png\" width=\"70%\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Because you only do one step, the ratio $(r_t(\\theta) = \\frac{\\pi_{\\theta}(a_t \\mid s_t)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(a_t \\mid s_t)})$, which relies on getting a \"new\" policy from updates, doesn't get a chance to iteratively update, and only changes once you do the gradient step at the end of an epoch, but then starts anew. *In this way, PPO can be less effective without minibatches*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the same data, except we batched our set of 16 into two 8-data point mini batches. Then, our updates become:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Epoch 1 with Mini-Batch Updates:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/policy-updates-2.png\" width=\"80%\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Epoch 2 with Mini-Batch Updates:\n",

    "**_Mini-batches allow intermediate updates within an epoch, where the \"old\" policy is held contstant to that at the start of the epoch, but the \"new\" policy can be updated via gradient descent to an intermittent state!_**\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that, while mini batching isn't *critical* to PPO's functionality, it certainly helps. Considering how large datasets are, processing in batches is almost always required computationally anyway. But in the case of PPO, there are these additional advantages to processing this way!\n",
    "\n",
    "> 📌 <font color=\"#996565\">**Note**: This isn't *just* for PPO. In RLHF, on-policy methods are the most common choice. For algorithms like PPO and TRPO, the idea of keeping a fixed “old” policy to compute importance sampling ratios makes techniques such as mini-batching particularly relevant in this way. But, off-policy methods of implementing rewards are possible, and *don’t* depend as directly on comparing an old versus a new policy, and therefore may not exhibit the same sensitivity to mini-batch versus full-batch SGD dynamics. So this aside will be implementation-dependent!</font>\n",

    "### (4) Value Functions in Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "The value function plays a crucial role in modern reinforcement learning for LLMs, serving as a predictor of expected rewards. In practice, value heads are typically implemented as small neural networks attached to the base LLM:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The value head usually consists of 1-2 fully connected layers (often with a $\\tanh$ activation)\n",
    "- It takes the final hidden state representation from the LLM (often just the last token)\n",
    "- The output is a single scalar representing the expected reward\n",
    "\n",
    "Most implementations keep the majority of parameters shared between the policy and value function, only adding a small number of value-specific parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The way the value function is trained can significantly impact performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Joint Training**: In this notebook, we use this simplified approach where the value function and policy are trained simultaneously with a combined loss. This works well for initial implementations but may lead to compromises in both policy and value accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternating Updates**: More sophisticated implementations alternate between policy and value updates, often performing multiple value updates for each policy update. This creates a more accurate value function at the cost of additional computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Separate Networks**: Some advanced systems maintain entirely separate networks for policy and value functions. While computationally expensive, this approach prevents interference between the two objectives and allows specialized architectures for each function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several practical issues dramatically affect value function implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reward Scaling**: Value functions must accurately predict rewards that might vary widely in scale. Common solutions include:\n",
    "- Normalizing rewards to zero mean and unit variance across batches\n",
    "- Using adaptive normalization that tracks running statistics\n",
    "- Employing specialized loss functions like Huber loss that are less sensitive to outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialization Strategy**: The initial state of the value function can significantly impact early training:\n",
    "- Poor initialization can lead to large, destabilizing updates\n",
    "- Some implementations pre-train the value function on collected trajectories before starting RL\n",
    "- Others initialize with small weights to ensure initial predictions stay close to zero\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Loss Balancing**: Finding the right balance between policy and value losses is crucial:\n",
    "- The coefficient (often denoted as $c_1$) typically ranges from 0.25 to 1.0\n",
    "- Too much weight on value loss can cause the model to focus on reward prediction at the expense of policy improvement\n",
    "- Too little weight can lead to inaccurate advantage estimates and unstable updates\n",
    "\n",
    "When implementing a PPO system in practice, carefully tuning these aspects of the value function can mean the difference between a stable, effective training process and one that fails to converge.\n",
