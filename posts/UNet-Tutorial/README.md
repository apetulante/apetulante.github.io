# UNet_Tutorial
A Jupyter notebook tutorial, walking through how a UNet convolutional neural network works. I have written it assuming that the reader has some prior knowledge about neural networks and/or convolutional networks, but that they may have forgotten most of it and need a refresher of the basics.

## Google Colab version (reccommended for viewing)
This notebook was originally created in Google Colab, and therefore was originally formatted to look best there. This link:

Will take you to the complete, already-ran Google Colab notebook, where all videos/animations are working. If you want, you can save a copy of this notebook to your own Google Drive, and run the cells/play with the notebook yourself. This will require getting the images/data that I use in the notebook (in the images/data folders of this repository) and moving them into your Google Drive so that the Google Colab notebook can have access to them.

## Jupyter Notebook version
The version of the notebook that is in this repository, UNet_Tutorial.ipynb, has been formatted to look best when displayed in the Jupyter Notebook web application. All content of the notebook is the same as the Google Colab notebook, but the formatting is slightly different. Due to the difficulty in displaying videos/animations in the Github preview of a Jupyter Notebook, the Google Colab version looks much nicer, so if you just plan on viewing the notebook without changing/re-running the cells, I reccommend you follow the link above and view that version. However, the UNet_Tutorial.ipynb version that is in this notebook is formatted to look nice/run well on your local machine, if you prefer that.
